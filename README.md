# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line

## Learning Objectives

    - At least four different sorting algorithms
    - What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
    - How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
    - What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Important:
My work on this project is based on inspirations from 7 Similar works and more on research using Youtube videos and MIT Lecs
